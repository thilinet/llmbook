      "Antibiotics are powerful medicines that fight bacterial infections. They work by either killing the bacteria or slowing down their growth, helping your immune system to eliminate the infection more effectively. Antibiotics do not help against viral infections such as colds and flu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a brief overview of how antibiotics work:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Target Bacterial Cells**: Antibiotics are designed to target specific structures or processes within bacteria, which human cells do not possess. This selectivity helps minimize harm to the host organism while effectively attacking the pathogens.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Killing/Inhibiting Growth**: There are two main types of antibiotics – Bactericidal (kills bacteria) and Bacteriostatic (inhibits growth). Bactericidal antibiotics, like penicillin, directly destroy bacterial cells. Bacteriostatic antibiotics, such as tetracycline, inhibit the ability of bacteria to grow or reproduce.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Different Modes of Action**: Antibiotics can work through various mechanisms, including:\n",
      "   * Inhibiting cell wall synthesis (e.g., beta-lactams such as penicillin and cephalosporins).\n",
      "   * Disrupting bacterial protein synthesis (e.g., tetracyclines and aminoglycosides).\n",
      "   * Interfering with nucleic acid synthesis (e.g., fluoroquinolones affect DNA replication, and rifampin inhibits RNA transcription).\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Antibiotic Spectrum**: Antibiotics can be broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum:\n",
      "   * Broad-spectrum antibiotics are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including both gram-positive and gram-negative species. They're often used when the causative agent is unknown (empirical therapy). However, their misuse can lead to increased antibiotic resistance.\n",
      "   * Narrow-spectrum antibiotics target a specific group of bacteria. These are typically preferred because they cause less disruption to the body's normal flora and have lower chances of causing resistance.\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. **Antibiotic Resistance**: One of the major challenges with antibiotics is the development of resistant strains of bacteria. This can happen due to genetic mutations or by acquiring resistance-conferring genes from other bacteria (horizontal gene transfer). Antibiotic misuse and overuse contribute significantly to this problem, leading to multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) that are difficult to treat.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. **Appropriate Use**: To preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics and combat resistance, it's essential for healthcare providers and patients alike to use them judiciously:\n",
      "   * Prescribers should only prescribe antibiotics when they are necessary (bacterial infections) and choose the most appropriate drug based on an accurate diagnosis.\n",
      "   * Patients must take medications exactly as directed, complete the full course even if symptoms improve, avoid sharing medication with others, and never use leftover antibiotics for self-treatment or other family members.\n",
      "   \n",
      "In summary, antibiotics are crucial tools in modern medicine that help treat bacterial infections effectively. However, their misuse can lead to significant challenges such as the emergence of resistant strains. Thus, responsible usage is vital for maintaining their effectiveness and public health.\n"

      "Antibiotics are powerful medications that fight bacterial infections by either killing the bacteria or inhibiting their growth. They work through various mechanisms, and here's a basic overview of antibiotics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Classes of Antibiotics: There are several classes of antibiotics, each with unique properties and functions. Some common classes include:\n",
      "   - Penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin): Inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis; first-line treatment for various infections.\n",
      "   - Cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone): Similar to penicillins, but with broader coverage against resistant bacteria.\n",
      "   - Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin and erythromycin): Inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit in bacteria; used for respiratory, skin, or sexually transmitted infections.\n",
      "   - Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline and minocycline): Also target protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, commonly prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections.\n",
      "   - Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin): Inhibit bacterial protein synthesis; used for severe or resistant gram-negative infections.\n",
      "   - Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin): Disrupt bacterial DNA replication by targeting enzymes involved in this process, often prescribed for serious bacterial infections.\n",
      "   - Glycopeptides (e.g., vancomycin): Inhibit cell wall synthesis but are typically used against resistant gram-positive bacteria like MRSA.\n",
      "   - Sulfonamides: Interfere with folic acid production, essential for DNA and RNA synthesis; broad-spectrum antibiotics, although less commonly prescribed nowadayer due to resistance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mechanisms of Action: Antibiotics can work by various mechanisms, such as inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, disrupting protein or DNA production, interfering with essential metabolic processes, or damaging the outer membrane of bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Proper Use and Resistance: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to increasing rates of resistance among bacterial strains. This makes it crucial for healthcare providers to prescribe antibiotics only when necessary, select the appropriate drug, dose, and duration, while patients must complete their full course as directed by a medical professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Side Effects: Antibiotics can cause side effects ranging from mild (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) to severe (e.g., allergic reactions or Clostridium difficile infection). It is essential for patients and healthcare providers to weigh the benefits of antibiotic treatment against possible risks before initiating therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, antibiotics are vital tools in combatting bacterial infections. However, their appropriate use and careful consideration of resistance patterns should always be emphasized to ensure effectiveness and safeguard public health.\n"

    "<Need to rewrite this one>\n",
    "Of course, many studies show that they have a generalization ability, where they might work well even on questions or tasks that don’t appear in training data. However, even if you have a really well-trained, the model itself is limited by their training data. What I mean is that you can not provide enough knowledge for them in some cases. The recent LLMs can do math pretty well, but they are not built for calculating tasks. Therefore, they will struggle with complex math equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the limitation of common knowledge. You take years for collecting data to train an LLM. But if you ask your LLM about the result of the game between Arsenal and Brighton yesterday, they just simply can’t answer correctly. The model can’t access the internet to find out, and the training data doesn’t have that information. That’s the reason we should connect LLMs with other tools to expand their power. And the agent is the one we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is a program that can “think” and interact with “the world”. Given a task, it will think about how to solve it, make a plan, do some actions to the environment, receive feedback, and repeat these steps until the task is done. For example, we can see a cleaning robot as an agent. We assign it the task of cleaning the bedroom. The robot received the requirement from the human. Then, it starts to think and make a plan for cleaning. It does some actions: go to the bedroom, start to collect garbage, etc. The sensors may help it to check its location, and avoid hitting stuff. The cleaning robot can interact with and receive feedback from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM agent is also the same. In this case, we exploit the LLM to help the agent can “think” since LLMs are quite good at reasoning tasks. To interact with “the world”, we add some tools that can act and receive results from “the world”."

      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said the mystified Mr. Kemp, pausing with a mug of beer\n",
      "midway to his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A rich uncle,\" continued the young man, lowering his voice to prevent\n",
      "any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge.  \"An\n",
      "uncle from New Zealand, who is going to leave me all 'is money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's it coming from?\"  demanded Mr. Kemp, with a little excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ain't coming,\" was the reply.  \"You've only got to say you've got it.\n",
      "Fact of the matter is, I've got my eye on a young lady; there's another\n",
      "chap after 'er too, and if she thought I'd got a rich uncle it might make\n",
      "all the difference.  She knows I 'ad an uncle that went to New Zealand\n",
      "and was never heard of since.  That's what made me think of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp drank his beer in thoughtful silence.  \"How can I be a rich\n",
      "uncle without any brass?\"  he inquired at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should 'ave to lend you some--a little,\" said Mr. Wright.\n",

      "be an uncle to me.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man pondered.  \"I've had money lent me before,\" he said,\n",
      "candidly, \"but I can't call to mind ever paying it back.  I always meant\n",
      "to, but that's as far as it got.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It don't matter,\" said the other.  \"It'll only be for a little while,\n",
      "and then you'll 'ave a letter calling you back to New Zealand.  See?  And\n",
      "you'll go back, promising to come home in a year's time, after you've\n",
      "wound up your business, and leave us all your money.  See?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp scratched the back of his neck.  \"But she's sure to find it out\n",
      "in time,\" he objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"P'r'aps,\" said Mr. Wright.  \"And p'r'aps not.  There'll be plenty of\n",

      "say you had got married yourself, or given your money to a hospital.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He ordered some more beer for Mr. Kemp, and in a low voice gave him as\n",
      "much of the family history as he considered necessary.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I took a fancy to you the moment I set eyes on you,\" rejoined Mr. Kemp.\n",

      "hat with some ceremony, shook hands with a good-looking young woman who\n",
      "stood behind the counter: Mr. Kemp, adopting an air of scornful dignity\n",
      "intended to indicate the possession of great wealth, waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is my uncle,\" said Mr. Wright, speaking rapidly, \"from New Zealand,\n",
      "the one I spoke to you about.  He turned up last night, and you might\n",
      "have knocked me down with a feather.  The last person in the world I\n",
      "expected to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp, in a good rolling voice, said, \"Good evening, miss; I hope you\n",

      "when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost\n",
      "assumed the dimensions of a grievance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It'll do to go on with,\" he said, smelling it suspiciously.  \"Have you\n",
      "got change for a fifty-pound note?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw, concealing her surprise by an effort, said that she would\n",
      "see, and was scanning the contents of a drawer, when Mr. Kemp in some\n",
      "haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoat-pocket.  Five\n",
      "minutes later he was sitting in the little room behind the shop, holding\n",
      "forth to an admiring audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So far as I know,\" he said, in reply to a question of Mrs. Bradshaw's,\n",
      "\"George is the only relation I've got.  Him and me are quite alone, and I\n",
      "can tell you I was glad to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bradshaw sighed.  \"It's a pity you are so far apart,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not for long,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I'm just going back for about a\n",
      "year to wind up things out there, and then I'm coming back to leave my\n",

      "\"He won't suffer for it, I'll be bound,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw, archly.\n",

      "the most comfortable chair in the room, described his life and struggles\n",

      "appeared to be responsible for a fortune which he affected to be too old\n",

      "round alone to-morrow evening.  It'll look better.  Just go in for\n",
      "another one of their sixpenny cigars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp obeyed, and the following evening, after sitting a little while\n",
      "chatting in the shop, was invited into the parlour, where, mindful of Mr.\n",
      "Wright's instructions, he held his listeners enthralled by tales of past\n",
      "expenditure.  A tip of fifty pounds to his bedroom steward coming over\n",
      "was characterized by Mrs. Bradshaw as extravagant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seems to be going all right,\" said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his\n",
      "report; \"but be careful; don't go overdoing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp nodded.  \"I can turn 'em round my little finger,\" he said.\n",
      "\"You'll have Bella all to yourself to-morrow evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright flushed.  \"How did you manage that?\"  he inquired.  \"It's the\n",
      "first time she has ever been out with me alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She ain't coming out,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"She's going to stay at home and\n",
      "mind the shop; it's the mother what's coming out.  Going to spend the\n",
      "evening with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright frowned.  \"What did you do that for?\"  he demanded, hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't do it,\" said Mr. Kemp, equably; \"they done it.  The old lady\n",
      "says that, just for once in her life, she wants to see how it feels to\n",
      "spend money like water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"<i>Money like water!</i>\"  repeated the horrified Mr. Wright.  \"Money like--\n",
      "I'll 'money' her--I'll----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It don't matter to me,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I can have a headache or a\n",
      "chill, or something of that sort, if you like.  I don't want to go.  It's\n",
      "no pleasure to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will it cost?\"  demanded Mr. Wright, pacing up and down the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rich uncle made a calculation.  \"She wants to go to a place called\n",
      "the Empire,\" he said, slowly, \"and have something for supper, and there'd\n",
      "be cabs and things.  I dessay it would cost a couple o' pounds, and it\n",
      "might be more.  But I'd just as soon ave' a chill--just.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright groaned, and after talking of Mrs. Bradshaw as though she were\n",
      "already his mother-in-law, produced the money.  His instructions as to\n",
      "economy lasted almost up to the moment when he stood with Bella outside\n",
      "the shop on the following evening and watched the couple go off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's wonderful how well they get on together,\" said Bella, as they\n",
      "re-entered the shop and passed into the parlour.  \"I've never seen mother\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I hope you like him, too,\" said Mr. Wright.\n",

      "\"He's a dear,\" said Bella.  \"Fancy having all that money.  I wonder what\n",
      "it feels like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I shall know some day,\" said the young man, slowly; \"but it\n",
      "won't be much good to me unless----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless?\"  said Bella, after a pause.\n",

      "and a lively whistle sounded.  She rose and went into the shop, and Mr.\n",
      "Wright settled back in his chair and scowled darkly as he saw the\n",
      "intruder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening,\" said the latter.  \"I want a sixpenny smoke for twopence,\n",
      "please.  How are we this evening?  Sitting up and taking nourishment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw told him to behave himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always do,\" said the young man.  \"That's why I can never get anybody to\n",
      "play with.  I had such an awful dream about you last night that I\n",
      "couldn't rest till I saw you.  Awful it was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it?\"  inquired Miss Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dreamt you were married,\" said Mr. Hills, smiling at her.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Me,\" said Mr. Hills, simply.  \"I woke up in a cold perspiration.\n",
      "Halloa! is that Georgie in there?  How are you, George?  Better?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm all right,\" said Mr. Wright, with dignity, as the other hooked the\n",
      "door open with his stick and nodded at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, why don't you look it?\"  demanded the lively Mr. Hills.  \"Have you\n",
      "got your feet wet, or what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, be quiet,\" said Miss Bradshaw, smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right-o,\" said Mr. Hills, dropping into a chair by the counter and\n",
      "caressing his moustache.  \"But you wouldn't speak to me like that if you\n",
      "knew what a terrible day I've had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been doing?\"  asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Working,\" said the other, with a huge sigh.  \"Where's the millionaire?\n",
      "I came round on purpose to have a look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him and mother have gone to the Empire?\"  said Miss Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hills gave three long, penetrating whistles, and then, placing his\n",
      "cigar with great care on the counter, hid his face in a huge\n",
      "handkerchief.  Miss Bradshaw, glanced from him to the frowning Mr.\n",
      "Wright, and then, entering the parlour, closed the door with a bang.  Mr.\n",
      "Hills took the hint, and with a somewhat thoughtful grin departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came in next evening for another cigar, and heard all that there was\n",
      "to hear about the Empire.  Mrs. Bradshaw would have treated him but\n",

      "telling me you came over here to get married, or did I dream it?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head at him again, and Mr. Hills, after\n",
      "apologizing to her for revealing her innermost thoughts before the most\n",
      "guileless of men, began to question Mr. Kemp as to the prospects of a\n",
      "bright and energetic young man, with a distaste for work, in New Zealand.\n",
      "The audience listened with keen attention to the replies, the only\n",
      "disturbing factor being a cough of Mr. Wright's, which became more and\n",
      "more troublesome as the evening wore on.  By the time uncle and nephew\n",
      "rose to depart the latter was so hoarse that he could scarcely speak.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright laughed disagreeably.  \"I dare say,\" he said; \"but I am\n",
      "managing this affair, not you.  Now, you go round to-morrow afternoon and\n",
      "tell them you're off.  D'ye hear?  D'ye think I'm made of money?  And\n",
      "what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool, Charlie Hills?  You\n",

      "He walked the rest of the way home in indignant silence, and, after\n",
      "giving minute instructions to Mr. Kemp next morning at breakfast, went\n",
      "off to work in a more cheerful frame of mind.  Mr. Kemp was out when he\n",

      "To his annoyance, he found Mr. Hills there again; and, moreover, it soon\n",

      "\n",

      "\"What I want you to do,\" said Mr. George Wright, as he leaned towards the\n",
      "old sailor, \"is to be an uncle to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said the mystified Mr. Kemp, pausing with a mug of beer\n",
      "midway to his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A rich uncle,\" continued the young man, lowering his voice to prevent\n",
      "any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge.  \"An\n",
      "uncle from New Zealand, who is going to leave me all 'is money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's it coming from?\"  demanded Mr. Kemp, with a little excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ain't coming,\" was the reply.  \"You've only got to say you've got it.\n",
      "Fact of the matter is, I've got my eye on a young lady; there's another\n",
      "chap after 'er too, and if she thought I'd got a rich uncle it might make\n",
      "all the difference.  She knows I 'ad an uncle that went to New Zealand\n",
      "and was never heard of since.  That's what made me think of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp drank his beer in thoughtful silence.  \"How can I be a rich\n",
      "uncle without any brass?\"  he inquired at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should 'ave to lend you some--a little,\" said Mr. Wright.\n",

      "be an uncle to me.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man pondered.  \"I've had money lent me before,\" he said,\n",
      "candidly, \"but I can't call to mind ever paying it back.  I always meant\n",
      "to, but that's as far as it got.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It don't matter,\" said the other.  \"It'll only be for a little while,\n",
      "and then you'll 'ave a letter calling you back to New Zealand.  See?  And\n",
      "you'll go back, promising to come home in a year's time, after you've\n",
      "wound up your business, and leave us all your money.  See?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp scratched the back of his neck.  \"But she's sure to find it out\n",
      "in time,\" he objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"P'r'aps,\" said Mr. Wright.  \"And p'r'aps not.  There'll be plenty of\n",

      "say you had got married yourself, or given your money to a hospital.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He ordered some more beer for Mr. Kemp, and in a low voice gave him as\n",
      "much of the family history as he considered necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've only known you for about ten days,\" he concluded, \"but I'd sooner\n",
      "trust you than people I've known for years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I took a fancy to you the moment I set eyes on you,\" rejoined Mr. Kemp.\n",
      "\"You're the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once,\n",
      "and was drowned afore my eyes the week after.  He 'ad a bit of a squint,\n",
      "and I s'pose that's how he came to fall overboard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He emptied his mug, and then, accompanied by Mr. Wright, fetched his sea-\n",
      "chest from the boarding-house where he was staying, and took it to the\n",
      "young man's lodgings.  Fortunately for the latter's pocket the chest\n",
      "contained a good best suit and boots, and the only expenses incurred were\n",
      "for a large, soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain.  Dressed in his\n",
      "best, with a bulging pocket-book in his breast-pocket, he set out with\n",
      "Mr. Wright on the following evening to make his first call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright, who was also in his best clothes, led the way to a small\n",
      "tobacconist's in a side street off the Mile End Road, and, raising his\n",
      "hat with some ceremony, shook hands with a good-looking young woman who\n",
      "stood behind the counter: Mr. Kemp, adopting an air of scornful dignity\n",
      "intended to indicate the possession of great wealth, waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is my uncle,\" said Mr. Wright, speaking rapidly, \"from New Zealand,\n",
      "the one I spoke to you about.  He turned up last night, and you might\n",
      "have knocked me down with a feather.  The last person in the world I\n",
      "expected to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp, in a good rolling voice, said, \"Good evening, miss; I hope you\n",
      "are well,\" and, subsiding into a chair, asked for a cigar.  His surprise\n",
      "when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost\n",
      "assumed the dimensions of a grievance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It'll do to go on with,\" he said, smelling it suspiciously.  \"Have you\n",
      "got change for a fifty-pound note?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw, concealing her surprise by an effort, said that she would\n",
      "see, and was scanning the contents of a drawer, when Mr. Kemp in some\n",
      "haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoat-pocket.  Five\n",
      "minutes later he was sitting in the little room behind the shop, holding\n",
      "forth to an admiring audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So far as I know,\" he said, in reply to a question of Mrs. Bradshaw's,\n",
      "\"George is the only relation I've got.  Him and me are quite alone, and I\n",
      "can tell you I was glad to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bradshaw sighed.  \"It's a pity you are so far apart,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not for long,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I'm just going back for about a\n",
      "year to wind up things out there, and then I'm coming back to leave my\n",
      "old bones over here.  George has very kindly offered to let me live with\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't suffer for it, I'll be bound,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw, archly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So far as money goes he won't,\" said the old man.  \"Not that that would\n",
      "make any difference to George.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be the same to me if you hadn't got a farthing,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Wright, promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"It'll do to go on with,\" he said]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp, somewhat affected, shook hands with him, and leaning back in\n",
      "the most comfortable chair in the room, described his life and struggles\n",
      "in New Zealand.  Hard work, teetotalism, and the simple life combined\n",
      "appeared to be responsible for a fortune which he affected to be too old\n",
      "to enjoy.  Misunderstandings of a painful nature were avoided by a timely\n",
      "admission that under medical advice he was now taking a fair amount of\n",
      "stimulant.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"'Ow much did you say you'd got in the bank?\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mind,\" he said, as he walked home with the elated George, \"it's your\n",
      "game, not mine, and it's sure to come a bit expensive.  I can't be a rich\n",
      "uncle without spending a bit.  'Ow much did you say you'd got in the\n",
      "bank?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must be as careful as we can,\" said Mr. Wright, hastily.  \"One thing\n",
      "is they can't leave the shop to go out much.  It's a very good little\n",
      "business, and it ought to be all right for me and Bella one of these\n",
      "days, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp, prompted by a nudge in the ribs, assented.  \"It's wonderful how\n",
      "they took it all in about me,\" he said; \"but I feel certain in my own\n",
      "mind that I ought to chuck some money about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell 'em of the money you have chucked about,\" said Mr. Wright.  \"It'll\n",
      "do just as well, and come a good deal cheaper.  And you had better go\n",
      "round alone to-morrow evening.  It'll look better.  Just go in for\n",
      "another one of their sixpenny cigars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp obeyed, and the following evening, after sitting a little while\n",
      "chatting in the shop, was invited into the parlour, where, mindful of Mr.\n",
      "Wright's instructions, he held his listeners enthralled by tales of past\n",
      "expenditure.  A tip of fifty pounds to his bedroom steward coming over\n",
      "was characterized by Mrs. Bradshaw as extravagant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seems to be going all right,\" said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his\n",
      "report; \"but be careful; don't go overdoing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp nodded.  \"I can turn 'em round my little finger,\" he said.\n",
      "\"You'll have Bella all to yourself to-morrow evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright flushed.  \"How did you manage that?\"  he inquired.  \"It's the\n",
      "first time she has ever been out with me alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She ain't coming out,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"She's going to stay at home and\n",
      "mind the shop; it's the mother what's coming out.  Going to spend the\n",
      "evening with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright frowned.  \"What did you do that for?\"  he demanded, hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't do it,\" said Mr. Kemp, equably; \"they done it.  The old lady\n",
      "says that, just for once in her life, she wants to see how it feels to\n",
      "spend money like water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"<i>Money like water!</i>\"  repeated the horrified Mr. Wright.  \"Money like--\n",
      "I'll 'money' her--I'll----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It don't matter to me,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I can have a headache or a\n",
      "chill, or something of that sort, if you like.  I don't want to go.  It's\n",
      "no pleasure to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will it cost?\"  demanded Mr. Wright, pacing up and down the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rich uncle made a calculation.  \"She wants to go to a place called\n",
      "the Empire,\" he said, slowly, \"and have something for supper, and there'd\n",
      "be cabs and things.  I dessay it would cost a couple o' pounds, and it\n",
      "might be more.  But I'd just as soon ave' a chill--just.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright groaned, and after talking of Mrs. Bradshaw as though she were\n",
      "already his mother-in-law, produced the money.  His instructions as to\n",
      "economy lasted almost up to the moment when he stood with Bella outside\n",
      "the shop on the following evening and watched the couple go off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's wonderful how well they get on together,\" said Bella, as they\n",
      "re-entered the shop and passed into the parlour.  \"I've never seen mother\n",
      "take to anybody so quick as she has to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you like him, too,\" said Mr. Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a dear,\" said Bella.  \"Fancy having all that money.  I wonder what\n",
      "it feels like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I shall know some day,\" said the young man, slowly; \"but it\n",
      "won't be much good to me unless----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless?\"  said Bella, after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless it gives me what I want,\" replied the other.  \"I'd sooner be a\n",
      "poor man and married to the girl I love, than a millionaire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw stole an uneasy glance at his somewhat sallow features, and\n",
      "became thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's no good having diamonds and motor-cars and that sort of thing\n",
      "unless you have somebody to share them with,\" pursued Mr. Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw's eyes sparkled, and at that moment the shop-bell tinkled\n",
      "and a lively whistle sounded.  She rose and went into the shop, and Mr.\n",
      "Wright settled back in his chair and scowled darkly as he saw the\n",
      "intruder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening,\" said the latter.  \"I want a sixpenny smoke for twopence,\n",
      "please.  How are we this evening?  Sitting up and taking nourishment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw told him to behave himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Always do,\" said the young man.  \"That's why I can never get anybody to\n",
      "play with.  I had such an awful dream about you last night that I\n",
      "couldn't rest till I saw you.  Awful it was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it?\"  inquired Miss Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dreamt you were married,\" said Mr. Hills, smiling at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bradshaw tossed her head.  \"Who to, pray?\"  she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me,\" said Mr. Hills, simply.  \"I woke up in a cold perspiration.\n",
      "Halloa! is that Georgie in there?  How are you, George?  Better?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm all right,\" said Mr. Wright, with dignity, as the other hooked the\n",
      "door open with his stick and nodded at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, why don't you look it?\"  demanded the lively Mr. Hills.  \"Have you\n",
      "got your feet wet, or what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, be quiet,\" said Miss Bradshaw, smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right-o,\" said Mr. Hills, dropping into a chair by the counter and\n",
      "caressing his moustache.  \"But you wouldn't speak to me like that if you\n",
      "knew what a terrible day I've had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you been doing?\"  asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Working,\" said the other, with a huge sigh.  \"Where's the millionaire?\n",
      "I came round on purpose to have a look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him and mother have gone to the Empire?\"  said Miss Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hills gave three long, penetrating whistles, and then, placing his\n",
      "cigar with great care on the counter, hid his face in a huge\n",
      "handkerchief.  Miss Bradshaw, glanced from him to the frowning Mr.\n",
      "Wright, and then, entering the parlour, closed the door with a bang.  Mr.\n",
      "Hills took the hint, and with a somewhat thoughtful grin departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came in next evening for another cigar, and heard all that there was\n",
      "to hear about the Empire.  Mrs. Bradshaw would have treated him but\n",
      "coldly, but the innocent Mr. Kemp, charmed by his manner, paid him great\n",
      "attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's just like what I was at his age,\" he said.  \"Lively.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not a patch on you,\" said Mr. Hills, edging his way by slow degrees\n",
      "into the parlour.  \"I don't take young ladies to the Empire.  Were you\n",
      "telling me you came over here to get married, or did I dream it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Ark at him,\" said the blushing Mr. Kemp, as Mrs. Bradshaw shook her\n",
      "head at the offender and told him to behave himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a man any woman might be happy with,\" said Mr. Hills.  \"He never\n",
      "knows how much there is in his trousers-pocket.  Fancy sewing on buttons\n",
      "for a man like that.  Gold-mining ain't in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head at him again, and Mr. Hills, after\n",
      "apologizing to her for revealing her innermost thoughts before the most\n",
      "guileless of men, began to question Mr. Kemp as to the prospects of a\n",
      "bright and energetic young man, with a distaste for work, in New Zealand.\n",
      "The audience listened with keen attention to the replies, the only\n",
      "disturbing factor being a cough of Mr. Wright's, which became more and\n",
      "more troublesome as the evening wore on.  By the time uncle and nephew\n",
      "rose to depart the latter was so hoarse that he could scarcely speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you tell 'em you had got a letter calling you home, as I told\n",
      "you?\"  he vociferated, as soon as they were clear of the shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I forgot it,\" said the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgot it!\"  repeated the incensed Mr. Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you think I was coughing like that for--fun?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot it,\" said the old man, doggedly.  \"Besides, if you take my\n",
      "advice, you'd better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright laughed disagreeably.  \"I dare say,\" he said; \"but I am\n",
      "managing this affair, not you.  Now, you go round to-morrow afternoon and\n",
      "tell them you're off.  D'ye hear?  D'ye think I'm made of money?  And\n",
      "what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool, Charlie Hills?  You\n",
      "know he is after Bella.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked the rest of the way home in indignant silence, and, after\n",
      "giving minute instructions to Mr. Kemp next morning at breakfast, went\n",
      "off to work in a more cheerful frame of mind.  Mr. Kemp was out when he\n",
      "returned, and after making his toilet he followed him to Mrs. Bradshaw's.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his annoyance, he found Mr. Hills there again; and, moreover, it soon\n",
      "became clear to him that Mr. Kemp had said nothing about his approaching\n",
      "departure.  Coughs and scowls passed unheeded, and at last in a\n",
      "hesitating voice, he broached the subject himself.  There was a general\n",
      "chorus of lamentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hadn't got the heart to tell you,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I don't know when\n",
      "I've been so happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you haven't got to go back immediate,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To-morrow,\" said Mr. Wright, before the old man could reply.\n",
      "\"Business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must you go,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp smiled feebly.  \"I suppose I ought to,\" he replied, in a\n",
      "hesitating voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back,\"\n",
      "urged Mr. Hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just for a few days,\" pleaded Bella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To please us,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw.  \"Think 'ow George'll miss you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lay hold of him and don't let him go,\" said Mr. Hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took Mr. Kemp round the waist, and the laughing Bella and her mother\n",
      "each secured an arm.  An appeal to Mr. Wright to secure his legs passed\n",
      "unheeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't let you go till you promise,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp smiled and shook his head.  \"Promise?\"  said Bella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well,\" said Mr. Kemp; \"p'r'aps--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must go back,\" shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let him speak for himself,\" exclaimed Bella, indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just another week then,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"It's no good having money if I\n",
      "can't please myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A week!\" shouted Mr. Wright, almost beside himself with rage and dismay.\n",
      "\"A week!  Another week!  Why, you told me----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't listen to him,\" said Mrs. Bradshaw.  \"Croaker!  It's his own\n",
      "business, ain't it?  And he knows best, don't he?  What's it got to do\n",
      "with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She patted Mr. Kemp's hand; Mr. Kemp patted back, and with his disengaged\n",
      "hand helped himself to a glass of beer--the fourth--and beamed in a\n",
      "friendly fashion upon the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"George!\"  he said, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wright, in a harsh voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you think to bring my pocket-book along with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mr. Wright, sharply; \"I didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tt-tt,\" said the old man, with a gesture of annoyance.  \"Well, lend me a\n",
      "couple of pounds, then, or else run back and fetch my pocket-book,\" he\n",
      "added, with a sly grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright's face worked with impotent fury.  \"What--what--do you--want\n",
      "it for?\"  he gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bradshaw's \"Well! Well!\" seemed to sum up the general feeling; Mr.\n",
      "Kemp, shaking his head, eyed him with gentle reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me and Mrs. Bradshaw are going to gave another evening out,\" he said,\n",
      "quietly.  \"I've only got a few more days, and I must make hay while the\n",
      "sun shines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Wright the room seemed to revolve slowly on its axis, but,\n",
      "regaining his self-possession by a supreme effort, he took out his purse\n",
      "and produced the amount.  Mrs. Bradshaw, after a few feminine\n",
      "protestations, went upstairs to put her bonnet on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you can go and fetch a hansom-cab, George, while she's a-doing of\n",
      "it,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"Pick out a good 'orse--spotted-grey, if you can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright arose and, departing with a suddenness that was almost\n",
      "startling, exploded harmlessly in front of the barber's, next door but\n",
      "one.  Then with lagging steps he went in search of the shabbiest cab and\n",
      "oldest horse he could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thankee, my boy,\" said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as he helped Mrs. Bradshaw in\n",
      "and stood with his foot on the step.  \"By the way, you had better go back\n",
      "and lock my pocket-book up.  I left it on the washstand, and there's best\n",
      "part of a thousand pounds in it.  You can take fifty for yourself to buy\n",
      "smokes with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of admiration, and Mr. Wright, with a frantic attempt\n",
      "to keep up appearances, tried to thank him, but in vain.  Long after the\n",
      "cab had rolled away he stood on the pavement trying to think out a\n",
      "position which was rapidly becoming unendurable.  Still keeping up\n",
      "appearances, he had to pretend to go home to look after the pocket-book,\n",
      "leaving the jubilant Mr. Hills to improve the shining hour with Miss\n",
      "Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp, returning home at midnight--in a cab--found the young man\n",
      "waiting up for him, and, taking a seat on the edge of the table, listened\n",
      "unmoved to a word-picture of himself which seemed interminable.  He was\n",
      "only moved to speech when Mr. Wright described him as a white-whiskered\n",
      "jezebel who was a disgrace to his sex, and then merely in the interests\n",
      "of natural science.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you worry,\" he said, as the other paused from exhaustion.  \"It\n",
      "won't be for long now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Long?\"  said Mr. Wright, panting.  \"First thing to-morrow morning you\n",
      "have a telegram calling you back--a telegram that must be minded.  D'ye\n",
      "see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" said Mr. Kemp, plainly.  \"I'm not going back, never no\n",
      "more--never!  I'm going to stop here and court Mrs. Bradshaw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright fought for breath.  \"You--you can't!\" he gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to have a try,\" said the old man.  \"I'm sick of going to sea,\n",
      "and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella,\n",
      "and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wright, trembling with rage, sat down to recover, and, regaining his\n",
      "composure after a time, pointed out almost calmly the various\n",
      "difficulties in the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought it all out,\" said Mr. Kemp, nodding.  \"She mustn't know I'm\n",
      "not rich till after we're married; then I 'ave a letter from New Zealand\n",
      "saying I've lost all my money.  It's just as easy to have that letter as\n",
      "the one you spoke of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I'm to find you money to play the rich uncle with till you're\n",
      "married, I suppose,\" said Mr. Wright, in a grating voice, \"and then lose\n",
      "Bella when Mrs. Bradshaw finds you've lost your money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp scratched his ear.  \"That's your lookout,\" he said, at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, look here,\" said Mr. Wright, with great determination.  \"Either you\n",
      "go and tell them that you've been telegraphed for--cabled is the proper\n",
      "word--or I tell them the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That'll settle you then,\" said Mr. Kemp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more than the other would,\" retorted the young man, \"and it'll come\n",
      "cheaper.  One thing I'll take my oath of, and that is I won't give you\n",
      "another farthing; but if you do as I tell you I'll give you a quid for\n",
      "luck.  Now, think it over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kemp thought it over, and after a vain attempt to raise the promised\n",
      "reward to five pounds, finally compounded for two, and went off to bed\n",
      "after a few stormy words on selfishness and ingratitude.  He declined to\n",
      "speak to his host at breakfast next morning, and accompanied him in the\n",
      "evening with the air of a martyr going to the stake.  He listened in\n",
      "stony silence to the young man's instructions, and only spoke when the\n",
      "latter refused to pay the two pounds in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news, communicated in halting accents by Mr. Kemp, was received with\n",
      "flattering dismay.  Mrs. Bradshaw refused to believe her ears, and it was\n",
      "only after the information had been repeated and confirmed by Mr. Wright\n",
      "that she understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must go,\" said Mr. Kemp.  \"I've spent over eleven pounds cabling\n",
      "to-day; but it's all no good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you're coming back?\"  said Mr. Hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O' course I am,\" was the reply.  \"George is the only relation I've got,\n",
      "and I've got to look after him, I suppose.  After all, blood is thicker\n",
      "than water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hear, hear!\" said Mrs. Bradshaw, piously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And there's you and Bella,\" continued Mr. Kemp; \"two of the best that\n",
      "ever breathed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies looked down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Charlie Hills; I don't know--I don't know <i>when</i> I've took such a\n",
      "fancy to anybody as I have to 'im.  If I was a young gal--a single young\n",
      "gal--he's--the other half,\" he said, slowly, as he paused--\"just the one I\n",
      "should fancy.  He's a good-'arted, good-looking----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Draw it mild,\" interrupted the blushing Mr. Hills as Mr. Wright bestowed\n",
      "a ferocious glance upon the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clever, lively young fellow,\" concluded Mr. Kemp.  \"George!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going now.  I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't\n",
      "want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer\n",
      "them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o'\n",
      "that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up and met Mr. Wright's eye; the latter, too affected to speak,\n",
      "took out the money and passed it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never know what may happen to us,\" said the old man, solemnly, as he\n",
      "rose and buttoned his coat.  \"I'm an old man and I like to have things\n",
      "ship-shape.  I've spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer, and if\n",
      "anything 'appens to my old carcass it won't make any difference.  I have\n",
      "left half my money to George; half of all I have is to be his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of an awed silence he went round and shook hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The other half,\" with his hand on the door--\"the other half and my best\n",
      "gold watch and chain I have left to my dear young pal, Charlie Hills.\n",
