    "# Chapter 2 - Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of any large language model lies the transformers. Proposed by in the seminal paper Attention is all you need by {cite:p}`vaswani2023attentionneed`, it has become the backbone for modern LLM. Original Transformer articulated in the paper is a neural network, consisting of the following modules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoder Module\n",
    "    This is made of several self attention module heads followed by a fully conntected layers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Decoder Module\n",
    "    Similar to an encoder module with attention heads followed by fully connected layers. In addtion to user input, this layer also takes in the embedding output from encoding module.\n",

    "Transformer Architecture\n",
    "```\n",
    "Transormer architecture is a deep learning neural network trained for language translation tasks. The Attention is all you need paper gives an example of training from english to german and french. You can think of it as two neural networks, an encoder and a decoder connected in a cascading manner to perform the translation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder converts the whole input english text into an embedded vector represenation. The decoder uses this embedded vector and translates one word a time. There are three types of transformers which evolved quickly after this paper was published.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encoder - Decoder transformers\n",
    "    They include both encoders and decoders. Translation models uses these architecture.  T5, BART etc. Their pre-training is task dependent. Tasks that involve both understanding and generating data. They first encode an input sequence into an internal represenation and then decode this represenation into an output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encoder only Transformers  \n",
    "    Models like BERT are encoder only transfomer.Their task involves only understanding. They are trained to do masked word prediction. Given a sentence, one of the word will be masked. Encoder only models are heavily used in classification tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Decoder only Transformers\n",
    "    In this book we will be looking at decoder only models. Decoder only models are trained to perform text generation. These models are also called as autoregressive models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The secret sauce in encoder / decoder architecture is the multi-head attention module. It is this attention mechanism module which claims to provide better contextual information and long term dependency features present in the input text data to the model. Let us lookat the following two examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The river bank is not accessible to the tourist.\n",
    "2. The robbers had planned a heist of major banks in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the example sentences have the word \"bank\". The context in the first sentence is \"river\" and the second sentence is \"heist\".  We want the model to treat the word \"bank\" with respect to their context in the sentence. Another example,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I went to the library yesterday, there i forgot my book. I am returning there today.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an English reader, if I ask you a question \"Were am I returning?\", you know that I am returning to the library. The previous sentence has the clue. This is a trivial example for long term dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where attention mechanism comes to rescue. Using attention mechanism we inject contextual information and long term dependency in to the model. We saw word embeddings in the previous chapter. Each word or a token had a unique position in the embedding space. However as we saw in the previous examples, these embeddings need to account for the contextual information in the input text. Attention mechanism adds these contextual information to the vector representaion of the token. More about attention in the subsequent sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALl the examples in this book are decoder only architecture. It is the widely used architecture for building causal LLMs."

    "## Why LLMs are decoder Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "Why most of the LLMs are decoder only models and not encoder-decoder model?\n",

    "According to {cite}'wang2022language' Decoder only models trained on next word prediction objective exibit the strongest zero-shot generalization after purely self-supervised pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models trained with masked language modeling objective, followed by mutitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Factors to consider while choosing between Decoder only or Encoder Decoder models.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1 cost of training\n",
    "      Decoder only models are cheaper to train. They can be trained on large unsupervised corpus\n",
    "      Encoder Decoder needs a lot of labelled data for  multitask finetuning.\n",
    "  2 Emerging Abilities\n",
    "      phenomenon where models display new, sophisticated capabilities not explicitly taught during training, arising naturally as the model scales in size\n",

    "  emergent abilities reduce the performance gap achieved by encoder decoder models over decoder-only ones with multitask finetuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. In-context learning from prompts\n",
    " \n",
    "      prompt engineering methods provide few-shot examples to help LLM understand the context or task. In context information can be seen to have a similar effect as gradient descent that updates the attention weight of the zero-shot prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Efficiency Optimization\n",
    " \n",
    "     In decoder only models, the key and value matrices from previous tokens can be reused for subsequent tokens during the decoding process. Since each position only attends to previous tokens the K and V matrices for those tokens remain unchaged. This caching mechanism improves effieciency by avoiding the recomputation of K and V matrices for tokens that have already been processed, facilitates faster generation and lower computation cost during inference.\n",

Varied attention is given to different numbers.In the example below we show a weighted average example by restricting the contribution of the three entities, to ten, thirty and sixty percentages. Let us take some liberty here for the sake for quickly grasping the concept of self-attention. Instead of calling these as weights, lets call them as attention.

    "So, what is self attention. Say we have six tokens in our input, \"The boat left the river bank.\" \n",
    "For each token we have a vector represenation in the form of embedding. If we take a dot product of the vectors for \"The\" and \"boat\", it gives us the strength of their relationship. Refer to previous chapter for vector represenation of words. So say we have an initial embedding for word \"The\". Now we do a dot product of word \"the\" and \"boat\", followed by dot product of \"The\" and \"left\" and so on. Let us call them attention weights, the strength of relationship between those words. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we start training a transformer for a language task, we choose to initialize these word embeddings in a random fashion leaving us with no control over the scale of the embedding values. Attention paper proposes to scale these values using square root of the embedding dimension. Hence we call this attention as scaled attention. After scaling we normalize normalize these weights to fall between zero and one. Normalizing the values help in stabilized training of LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will enrich the embedding representation of each word with these scaled normalized attention weights. We take the embedding for the word \"The\", we multiply it with attention weight for \"The\". The embedding for \"The\" is now enriched with its relationship with itself. To this add the next enriched vector, the embedding vector for \"The\" multipled by attention weight for the word \"boat\" and so on. The final vector called context vector for the word \"The\" is thus formed by addition. Through this weighted sum, the context vector for each word is now enriched by their strength of relationship with their neighbors. The input is enriched by its constituents and hence the name self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up scaled self-attention, the input is enriched by its constituents and hence self, the contribution of the words in the input to each other is the attention and finally these attention weights are scaled by square root of embedding dimension and hence scaled is used in naming this.\n",

    "dot product explanation comes here.\n",

    "To demonstrate this concept, let us create some dummy word embeddings. For the purpose of illustration we we will stick with word tokens and not their integer encoding. In the previous chapter we studied about integer encoding followed by token embedding. For bruety purpose let us skip directly to token embeddings."

    "Another important concept to grasp before we move further is Masking. Let us see what is masking and why need masking. We perform masking to avoid data leakage. While we train the transformer to perform the next word prediction, we should avoid giving any information about the next word it is supposed to predict.In the previous example, while doing the weighted sum addition, we enriched the vector representation for word \"The\" w the ith all the other words in the sequence. While we expect the transformer to predict, \"Boat\" after \"The\", we have introduced leakage by providing information about \"Boat\" to the model while training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the context vector creation. We enrich the original embedding vector with attention scores. We dont want to enrich word \"The\" with the scores of \"boat\" before the model sees the word \"boat\". In the next step, when the model sees the word \"The\" and \"boat\", we will enrich it with the scores from \"boat\". We can do this by using a mask, where we will mask the upper triangle of our attenion score matrix.\n",

Let us spend some time understanding the importance of these trainable weights.\n",

A graph with lot of curves, a quadratic equation will be more suitable than a linear equation. The difference is in the number of coeffiecients. The linear equation has a single coeffiecient, the slope. However quadratic equation will have multiple coeffiecients and will be able to do better in fitting the curve.\n",
