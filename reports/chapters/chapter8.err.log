    >>> Why is the sky blue in color?
     The sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight travels through Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and small particles that are much 
    smaller than its wavelength. These particles scatter shorter-wavelength light (blue and violet) more effectively than longer-wavelength light (red, orange).
    
    However, our eyes are less sensitive to violet light, and the Sun emits less violet light compared to blue light; that's why we see a predominantly blue sky during daytime. At sunrise or sunset, 
    when the light path through the atmosphere is longer, even more scattering of red and orange wavelengths occurs, which makes the sky appear in shades of red, pink, and orange.
    
    The overall color perception can also be affected by atmospheric conditions such as pollution or dust particles. But under normal circumstances on a clear day, Rayleigh scattering is responsible 
    for the blue coloration of our sky.
